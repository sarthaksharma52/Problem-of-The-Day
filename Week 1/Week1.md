### Week 1 Problem Statements

### Day 1
### Sum of dependencies in a graph
Given a directed graph with V nodes and E edges, if there is an edge from u to v, then we will say that u depends on v. Number of Dependencies (NoD) for a node x is the total count of nodes that x depends upon. Find out the sum of number of dependencies of every node.

Input:
V = 4
E = 4
Edges = { {0,2}, {0,3}, {1,3}, {2,3} }

Output : 4
